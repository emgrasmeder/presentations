# Bias

---
### Bias
# `<picture of a politician here>`

---
### Bias
- Representation Bias
- Availability Bias
- Adjustment and Anchoring

---
### Representation Bias
#### Steve is very shy and also introverted. He loves books, his favorite genre is fantasy. It's one of Steve's dreams to one day write a book.	
Is Steve more likely to be a software developer or a librarian? 

---
### Representation Bias
There are ~3.5x as many software developers than librarians. It's more probable that Steve is a software dev who likes books.   

---
### Availability Bias
<img width="500" alt="screen shot 2016-10-06 at 2 55 11 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8107614/19168602/d165a724-8bde-11e6-81fb-d95586dcfa34.png">

---
### Availability Bias
Events that are easier to recall seem more likely.
  - You're much more likely to be killed by a coconut than a shark
---
### Availability Bias
Events that are easier to recall seem more likely.
  - This might be one of the reasons our otherwise levelheaded friends hold on to their anti-black, anti-Islam, etc racist bullshit

---
### Adjustment and Anchoring
`Emma: <hands out some pieces of paper>`

---
### Adjustment and Anchoring
- Given only 5 seconds, people estimate 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 higher than 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8
- First impressions set the tone; stores do this to get you to accept higher prices

---
### Confirmation Bias
- Overvaluing the answers you wanted to hear

---
### Bias
## people are bad at (rather, tend to avoid) making perfectly objective decisions
## cutting corners takes a big cognitive load off

---
### Bias
People make biased decisions

---
### Bias
People make biased decisions
- you do it
- your boss does it
- I do it

---
### Bias
People make biased decisions
- you do it
- your boss does it
- I do it
- We don't have bosses at Mapbox 

---
### Bias
People make biased decisions
- you do it
- your boss does it
- I do it
- We don't have bosses at Mapbox 
  - We still have biases

---
## We need ways to communicate - and hold ourselves accountable - to reality

## How do you know if you're bad at something?

---
### The League
## How do you know if you're bad at something?
## (Answer: scientifically)

---
### Step 1a: Hypothesis  
Formally declare your hypotheses:

---
### Step 1b: Hypothesis  
- One trivial, hopefully soon-to-be-refuted hypothesis
  - `null hypothesis` 
  - aka `baseline`
  - aka `control`
- One or more nontrivial, maybe-the-data-will-agree hypothesis
  - `treatment`
  - aka `test`

---
### Step 1c: Hypothesis: Fantasy Hockey
- Baseline: how well would a hypothetical player perform if they tossed a coin for every decision
  - uniform random chances for each decision is a trivial baseline
- Null Hypothesis: I perform about as well as a random number generator
- Alternative Hypothesis 1: I perform better than random
- Alternative Hypothesis 2: I perform worse than random

### Uniform Distribution
Equal likelihoods all around
![](http://ptgptb.org/0009/image002.gif)

---
### Uniform Distribution
- toss of the dice
- coin flip
- what day of the month you're born

---
### Uniform Distribution
Good for our ice-hockey baseline

---
### Uniform Distribution
If a robot plays fantasy hockey making choices across a uniform distribution of options, can you do better?

---
### Uniform Distribution
If a robot plays fantasy hockey making choices across a uniform distribution of options, can you do better?
- This sets the bar really low, but at least we have an objective measurement to compare against

---
### Uniform Distribution
1. Set a baseline
2. Propose a change
3. Compare the distribution of outcomes between the baseline and your work
4. If your change is better than the baseline, your change is the new baseline

### Logistic Regression Analysis 
Null Hypothesis:
  - Birth month is predicted by a uniform distribution
    - (we call it the "error term")
Alternative Hypothesis
- Birth month is predicted by the `error term` plus `hours of daylight` plus `average temperature`

# Disparate things I want people to know

---
### Things I want people to know
# Expected Values

---
### Expected Values
In simple cases, the same as an `average`

---
### Expected Values
- likelihood of `thing` * `magnitude of that thing`

---
### Expected Values
- likelihood of `thing` * `magnitude of that thing`
- Should switch from the orange to the red line or just walk?

---
### Expected Values
- likelihood of `thing` * `magnitude of that thing`
- Should switch from the orange to the red line or just walk?
  - uniform chance of having just missed the train or just making it, or anything in between

---
### Expected Values
- likelihood of `thing` * `magnitude of that thing`
- Should switch from the orange to the red line or just walk?
  - uniform chance of having just missed the train or just making it, or anything in between
  - expected value of _wait_ for train is the 1/2 * the maximum wait length aka the average wait time

---
### Waiting for the train
- Walking
  - 100% chance of taking 20 minutes
- Metroing
  - hard to say what the chance of a 20 minute commute is
  - Expected transfer time = 10-15 minutes in off peak hours

---
## What about an unpredicted shutdown?
<img width="577" alt="screen shot 2016-10-08 at 11 26 31 am" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8107614/19214090/1c20b292-8d4a-11e6-86a3-71c1f3d71030.png">

---
### Expected Values
- Step 1. Calculate the likelihood of a metro fire
- Step 2. Calculate the magnitude of a metro fire
- Step 3. add `(likelihood * probability)` to total expected metro commute time

---
### Expected Values
To be fair, we need to calculate the expected value of being hit by a car while on foot, too
- Step 1. Calculate the likelihood of being struck by a car
- Step 2. Calculate the time cost of getting hit
- Step 3. add `(likelihood * probability)` to total expected commute by foot

---
### Expected Values
- Cost of metro = price + expected length of time + likelihood of injury
- Cost of walking = 0 + expected length of time + likelihood of injury
such that injury costs time and money

---
# At what point do you just decide to take a car?

---
### Opportunity cost
- Walking and public transit are less expensive

---
### Opportunity cost
- Walking and Public transit are less expensive
- What is your time worth?

---
### Opportunity cost
- Walking and Public transit are less expensive
- What is your time worth?
  - A decent proxy is your wage

---
### Opportunity cost
- Walking and Public transit are less expensive
- What is your time worth?
  - A decent proxy is your wage
