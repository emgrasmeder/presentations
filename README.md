# presentations
###### where my markdown, scroll down presentations live

Some presentations are made to be viewed with [cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver). 

```shell
git clone git@github.com:emmagras/presentations.git
cd presentations
npm install -g cleaver
```

Once you have the presentation on your computer, you can 

`sh present.sh name-of-presentation.md`

and yer done!
