# a function turns an input into an output
# `round(3.14)` turns into `3.0`
# `math.floor(98.6)` turns into `98.0`
# sometimes functions do unexpected things:
## `round(3.49)` becomes `3.0` 
## but `round(3.499999999999999999999999999999)` becomes `4.0`

# `assert round(3.49) == 3.0`
# `assert makeBackwards("Hello world!") == "!dlrow olleH"`
# `assert function(controlledInput) == expectedOutput`
