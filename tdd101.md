# without tests, how can you be sure your code behaves

# if it matters, test it. prove that it works.

# Writing tests will make you:
## - write better code 
## - learn how the language works
## - confident that your code does what it should

# What tools do we need?
# 1) Functions.
# A function turns an input into an output
# Examples of functions:
# `round(3.14)` --> `3.0`
# `print("hello world!")` --> `hello world!`
# functions take `arguments` as input

# What tools do we need?
# 2) Assertions.
# `assert` is a special function.
# assertions usually yell when you give it something `false`

# How does the process go?
# Step 1: Write the test
# Step 2: Write code that makes the test pass
# Step 3: Write another test
# Step 4: Write code that makes the test pass
# Step 5: Do I like this code? Should I refactor?
# Step 6: Write another test...
