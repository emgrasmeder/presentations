# without tests, how can you be sure your code behaves

# if it matters, test it. prove that it works.

# Writing tests will make you:
## - write better code 
## - learn how the language works
## - confident that your code does what it should

# Practically: What tools do we need?
# 1) Functions.
# A function turns an input into an output
# Examples of functions:
# `round(3.14)` --> `3.0`
# `print("hello world!")` --> `hello world!` in `stdout`
# almost everything you type into terminal is actually a function call

# 2) Assertions.
# `assert` is also a function. A special function.
# `assert` will yell at you if you lie to it
