# without tests, how can you be sure your code behaves

# if it matters, test it. prove that it works.

# Writing tests will make you:
## - write better code 
## - learn how the language works
## - confident that your code does what it should

# Practically: What tools do we need?
# 1) Functions. 2) Assertions
# A function turns an input into an output
# `round(3.14)` turns into `3.0`
# `cd ../..` is:
### a function called `cd` that takes `../..` as an argument

# `assert` is also a function. 
# `assert` will yell at you if you lie to it
